A program to demonstrate Storage Classes in C


Demonstrating auto class

Value of the variable 'a' declared as auto: 32
--------------------------------
Demonstrating register class

Value of the variable 'b' declared as register: 71
--------------------------------
Demonstrating extern class

Value of the variable 'x' declared as extern: 0
Modified value of the variable 'x' declared as extern: 2
--------------------------------
Demonstrating static class

Declaring 'y' as static inside the loop.
But this declaration will occur only once as 'y' is static.
If not, then every time the value of 'y' will be the declared value 5 as in the case of variable 'p'

Loop started:

The value of 'y', declared as static, in 1 iteration is 6
The value of non-static variable 'p', in 1 iteration is 11

The value of 'y', declared as static, in 2 iteration is 7
The value of non-static variable 'p', in 2 iteration is 11

The value of 'y', declared as static, in 3 iteration is 8
The value of non-static variable 'p', in 3 iteration is 11

The value of 'y', declared as static, in 4 iteration is 9
The value of non-static variable 'p', in 4 iteration is 11

Loop ended:
